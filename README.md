# Physics Playground ðŸŒŒ

Physics is one of the most fascinating fields that beautifully bridges the abstract world of mathematics with the tangible realities of our universe. From the elegant motion of celestial bodies to the mysterious behaviors of subatomic particles, physics reveals the underlying principles that govern everything around us.

Iâ€™ve always been captivated by the way physics can explain phenomena we experience daily and even those far beyond our reach. The interplay of concepts like energy, motion, gravity, and time sparks a deep sense of wonder and curiosity.

This repository is my humble attempt to dive deeper into the realm of physics through code and theory.
